# 6-Day MEP Implementation Plan for Diplomacy

This implementation plan outlines a structured approach to creating a Maximum Entropy Population-Based Training (MEP) agent for Diplomacy using the yussefahmed/diplomacy environment. The plan is divided into six days of focused development.

## Day 1: Environment Setup and Baseline Implementation

1. Clone and install the yussefahmed/diplomacy repository with all dependencies
2. Create a simple agent class that interfaces with the Diplomacy environment
3. Implement state encoding and action decoding functions
4. Build a random baseline agent for testing the environment
5. Set up logging for game states, actions, and rewards
6. Run test games to verify environment connectivity 
7. Create a policy network architecture suitable for the Diplomacy state space

## Day 2: Population Management and Training Framework

1. Implement a PPO (or similar) algorithm for agent training
2. Create a PopulationManager class to handle multiple agents
3. Implement saving and loading mechanisms for agents
4. Build a training loop structure for population members
5. Design evaluation methods to compare agent performance
6. Set up monitoring tools for training progress
7. Create a basic framework for parallel training of agents

## Day 3: Entropy Implementation

1. Implement policy entropy calculation for Diplomacy actions
2. Create KL divergence calculation between different policies
3. Implement Population Diversity (PD) objective combining entropy and KL divergence
4. Develop Population Entropy (PE) as a computationally efficient surrogate objective
5. Verify and test entropy calculations with sample Diplomacy states
6. Integrate entropy bonus into reward function
7. Set up adjustable entropy coefficient for training

## Day 4: Population Training with Entropy

1. Complete the training pipeline with entropy integration
2. Begin training a small population (3-5 agents) with entropy bonus
3. Implement checkpointing to save agent states during training
4. Monitor population entropy values throughout training
5. Analyze population diversity with visualization tools
6. Optimize training parameters for better performance
7. Debug any issues encountered during population training

## Day 5: Prioritized Sampling and Final Agent Training

1. Implement difficulty metrics based on agent performance
2. Create ranking and sampling probability calculation
3. Build prioritized sampling mechanism with temperature control
4. Set up best response training framework against the population
5. Begin training the final agent using the diverse population
6. Monitor performance against different population members
7. Track generalization metrics throughout training

## Day 6: Testing, Refinement and Documentation

1. Complete final agent training
2. Test agent against all population members and baselines
3. Identify and address any weaknesses in the agent
4. Document code with clear comments and function descriptions
5. Create a comprehensive README with setup and usage instructions
6. Prepare demonstration scripts for showcasing the agent
7. Package final code and trained models for delivery

## Implementation Notes

### Key Components of MEP
- **Population Diversity (PD)**: Combines individual policy entropy and KL divergence between policies
- **Population Entropy (PE)**: Computationally efficient surrogate for PD (proven lower bound)
- **Prioritized Sampling**: Focuses training on more challenging partners

### Mathematical Foundations
- Population Entropy is defined as: PE({π¹, π², ..., πⁿ}, s) := H(π̄(·|s))
- Where π̄ is the mean policy: π̄(a|s) := (1/n)∑ᵢ πⁱ(a|s)
- Prioritized sampling probability: p(πⁱ) ∝ [rank(1/E[∑ᵣ R(s, aᵃ, aⁱ)])]^β

### Computational Requirements
Training reinforcement learning agents for Diplomacy is computationally intensive. Consider:
- Using GPU acceleration where possible
- Implementing efficient state representations
- Starting with smaller game variants if needed
- Using parallel training to maximize efficiency

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to developing a MEP agent for Diplomacy within a six-day timeframe. Adjustments may be needed based on the specific challenges encountered during implementation.
